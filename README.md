# imaginary-faces

I asked [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/) a simple question:

```
/imagine prompt:"Imagine the most stereotypical person in X"
```

Where `X` is a country. I then took the first result without any second attempts
or filtering and used it as a background of the corresponding country on a map.

## Results

Please keep in mind:

1. These are not real people and model is explicitly asked to be stereotypical (biased).
2. These images do not represent the diversity and complexity of each country
3. I'm just curious how the world looks like through the eyes of a machine learning model. 


## Tech stack

The images were generated by manually entering the query for each country. The high-definition
images took 900MB of disk space, so I used https://squoosh.app/ to compress them.

The map is rendered using [maplibre](https://maplibre.org/) and [natural earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) data.

Each image is loaded individually into the browser and then cropped to fit the country's shape. So initial load
time is a bit slow for my liking, but once all countries are loaded - it's pretty fast.
